=== First Star

How does it work: +

Today I did not really get a good grip on the puzzle, I guess my problem lies in not defining a clear data structure, so the access to the data needed a lot of copying and steps in between to prepare the data.

[source, kotlin, numbered]
....
include::day2021_1_2.kts[tags=allergen]
....

=== Second Star

How does it work: +

After part 1 was finished, this was easy, since I already hat the allergens in a Map, I just needed to sort them by key and put all values together in a string.

[source, kotlin, numbered]
....
include::day2021_1_2.kts[tags=allergen_2]
....

Finally, print out the solution for both puzzles:
