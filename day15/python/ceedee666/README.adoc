== Day 15

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution::
* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* The collections library for the defaultdict

=== Idea

The idea for part one is to use a dict to store the memory of the game. 
The idea for part two is brute force. Fortunately, this worked....

=== What I learned

I really start to like to represent data in python as dicts.

=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python day15 --help`
