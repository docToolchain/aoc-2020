== Groovy

Here is another solution written in Groovy.
First I split the input into a list of Integers:
[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=splitInput]
....

=== Part 1:
Iterate over all numbers and check if the numbers before sum up to the number. If no sum is found, stop the execution and return the number without sum.
[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=solvePart1]
....
When the loop stops, the current accumulator is returned

=== Part 2:
First I need to get the missing sum from part 1.
Then I iterate over all number of the input and add them with their following numbers as long their sum is smaller then the missing sum.
If their sum is the missing sum, I found the contiguous sum and just need to add the smallest and the biggest number to get the solution.
[source, groovy]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=solvePart2]
....
