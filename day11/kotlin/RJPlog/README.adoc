The puzzle input is read into a map, and step by step for each posiition the rules for taking a seat or standing up are applied. This is coninued until no change takes place, and the resulting numbers of occupied places are returned.

[source, kotlin, numbered]
....
include::day2011_1_2.kts[tags=create_seat_plan]
....


=== Second Star

How does it work: +

Here it works pretty much the same way, only the new rules have to be applied, which results in some more effort due to the fact that not only the adjacent seats have to be taken into consideration but the complete direction until a seat is found.

[source, kotlin, numbered]
....
include::day2011_1_2.kts[tags=create_seat_plan_2]
....

Finally, print out the solution for both puzzles:
