== Day 1: Report Repair  ==

This solution is written in Groovy.

The original puzzle can be found at https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/1

For execution enter `./solution.groovy` in the command line.
This is possible because I looked up the right shebang for the first line of the file to tell bash to use groovy.

=== Read File

To read and parse the file in groovy is a one-liner.
I parse the file to a map which makes it easy and fast to iterate over it.

[source,groovy, linenums]

=== First Star

Let's do this brute force.
I iterate over the input and do `input.size()^2` calculations.
Since this is quite fast, I don't care to break when I found the right solution.
Just print it out.

=== Second Star

Same as the first star, but this time I do `imput.size()^3` calculations, because I added a third loop.
