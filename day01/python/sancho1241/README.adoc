== Day 01

== Parsing

Data is read from file 'input.txt', converted to a list and then casted to integer values for calculation

== Algorithm

Using multiple nested list iterations and just brute forcing all combinations. Printed and flagged once found. 
Neither elegant nor optimized but working for this small data set. Decided to integrate Star2 steps into Star 1 solution. Wanted to use list comprehension but had no time for research.
