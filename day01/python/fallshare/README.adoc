Day 1: Report Repair 
== Python

=== Today I learned
 . that I should not copy the puzzle input from someone else since it is personalized.
 . lists in Python use references. I have to explicitly create a copy if I want to manipulate at list without impacting the original message.
Run the solution with `python solution.py`
 . That I can learn a lot by looking at the solutions of others

[source, python]
....
include::solution.py[]
