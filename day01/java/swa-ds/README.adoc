= Day 01

To run the program, you need JDK 11.
Thanks to http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/330[JEP 330], launching is as easy as `java Day01.java`.

== Reading the input file

----
include::Day01.java[tags=readFile]
----

Reading files isn't a big deal in Java anymore.
From `Files.lines(...)` we get a Stream of Strings which we then can easily turn into an int array.

== The solution

The brute force solution is straightforward, using nested for loops.
It is quite fast nevertheless.

=== Part 1

[source,java, linenums]
----
include::Day01.java[tags=part1]
----
Two nested `foreach` loops do the trick.

=== Part 2

[source,java, linenums]

----
include::Day01.java[tags=part2]
----
Same as before, but with three nested loops instead.
